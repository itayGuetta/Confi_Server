##  Project Purpose
Confi_Server project is to save the repetitive action of setting up an environment and a similar server for each application. Nowadays every project needs to set up this time-consuming environment and usually need to learn a new language that takes time to figure out how to get along with it. Today there are similar libraries on the net but they are not understood and do not have a guide in Hebrew.
Confi_Server will provide a new solution for students in College.
Confi_Server will be open source, which each student will be able to add and improve the project for the following.
